# News
Character AI developers are constantly updating the website. This comes with many new issues for this extension and I would like to have your new Github issues or emails for reporting. Feature requests are also welcome.

# Known problems
- Chat duplication doesn't work on Firefox because of Firefox's extremely strict WebSocket policies or whatever. It doesn't even give me error message
